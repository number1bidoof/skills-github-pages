What did I do during winter break????

- I went to new york!!!! it was really fun & I got to hang out with a lot of my friends. I really liked the city & would def go back to visit sometime soon! Next time I would have gone to a xav show 👀👀 But all the riverside tickets were sold out 😿
- I however, did not get a chopped cheese 😿, nor did I get a metrocard 😿, nor did I get to talk to cranes even tho I did recognize him on the streets of flushing
- I played a lot of animal crossing. Every year I remeber about my island and try to play it again. all my vilagers hate me but ive been trying to re-decorate my island again

And a whole lott of sleeping
